# Purpose

Just a basic todo app for command line

- [] Add todos
- [] Remove todos
- [] Check todos

# How

Possible things to do :

- Store all the todos in a txt file and then edit txt file as a database

- Use notion api and add the todos to notion and then this will basically be
    a command line client for notion api which is good but again far from what
    I am making so nope :(
